# Multi-Agent-via-Switchable-ADG


The graph folder contains the graph interface functions and their implementation. Currently it uses 3 internal graphs to maintain the type 1 edges, non-switchable type 2 edges and switchable type 2 edges. In each case the graph is represented by an adjacency set of out neighbors and in neighbors.

The ADG folder contains the interface for building and interacting with an ADG. 

The A* folder has an A* implementation that takes an ADG and searches for the best possible re-routing
