# Multi-Agent-via-Switchable-ADG


The graph folder contains the graph interface functions and their implementation.

The ADG folder contains the interface and implementation of a TPG (which includes a graph and some auxiliary information such as the actual paths on a map).

The Algorithm folder contains the implementation of our heuristic search algorithm and a simulator class. The simulator class is used in the execution-based module of the algorithm.

The simulate.cpp file is used to simulate the delay (before replanning), print the start and goal locations for replanning, and drive the entire code.


The types.h file contains the type definitions for the data structures that we use.
